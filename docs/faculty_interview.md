# Interview with Faculty Member Notes
### Nicole Gorrell

I interview a professor outside of the CS Department because I thought it would be interesting to hear a non-student perspective regarding cancer skins, skincare, and using some sort of bodily recognition software, while also maintaining that the interviewee may not have necessarily been well-versed with technology. Below are the questions I asked the interviewee and her responses that I annotated:

1. What is your name and occupation?

Valerie Benoist, Professor in the Spanish Department and Latin American Studies Concentration.

2. Are you familiar with some of the signs of skin cancer to look out for? If so, what would you say they are?

Semi-familiar. Aware of spots of skin that could be dark or of irregular shape. She sees a dermatologist yearly due to a familial history of age spots.

3. Have you ever used a website or app where you had to upload an image of yourself for health reasons? If so, what was your experience with that process? 

- No, but guesses that her experience would be "terrible"
  - She shares a story from when she taught virtually and was part of a remote college subcommittee where a camera would spotlight each other member except her. She also connected a limited knowledge of technology with this bad experience to reflect a sense of discomfort with potentially using technology in such a personal manner for health reasons.
- She revisits this question in dialogue with the next question. Recounts how she was once asked by a friend to try such a platform to get recommendations for anti-aging products. She didn't try it because it "seemed like a scam".

4. If you haven't used such a tool, would you be willing to use one? Why or why not?

- She would first have to know exactly what it's (i.e. photo data, user data) being used for, and if it would not involve a process that cannot be achieved in person (such as by visiting a doctor).
- She'd much rather have the in-person experience.
- She'd also want to know who is it (personal data) going to be shared with, for what purposes, and that her data would not be shared without her permission. Nevertheless, she still wouldn't completely trust the platform.
- She would also be suspicious of the degree that such information (i.e. the generation of advice using user data, seeking out a non-professional service) could or could not be used against users for insurance claims/purposes.
- She is familiar with skincare consultations online, but this familiarity does not necessarily ease her described concerns.

5. What are your skincare concerns?

Aging spots, as she has more than most people. They are hereditary, and this factor and their increased presence over time make her more susceptible to develop skin cancer. She shared that both sides of her family have remained cancer free, but that she still exercises caution and takes the precautions she can to monitor her spots.

6. Do you already have a skincare routine? What kinds of products do you use?

Uses suncreen with an SPF of 50 or higher and tries to avoid peak hours of UV exposure when possible (such as midday). Some habits
