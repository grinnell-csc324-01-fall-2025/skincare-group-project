**Tasks:**

*   Get result from taking an image
    *   Pretty straightforward and intuitive
*   Get results from choosing an image from the photo library
    *   Similarly to above, straightforward and intuitive
*   Take a picture of your face and get results from that image
    *   Possible, but a little difficult and awkward. Considering this is a skin care app, this should be a functionality
*   Choose an image and then choose a different one instead.
