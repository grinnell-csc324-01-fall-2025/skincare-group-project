# Zak's Interview with a Staff member

---

### 1. What is your name, age, and occupation?
Dillyn, 25, Tier 1 Support Specialist at Grinnell ITS.

---

### 2. Are you familiar with some of the signs of skin cancer to look out for? If so, what would you say they are?
Yes. Mainly when moles or spots change in size, shape, or color. I’ve heard that irregular edges or new growths can also be warning signs.

---

### 3. Have you ever used a website or app where you had to upload an image of yourself for health or skincare reasons? If so, what was your experience like?
No, I haven’t used one before. I’ve mostly used fitness or health tracking apps, but nothing that involves facial images.

---

### 4. If you haven’t used such a tool, would you be willing to use one? Why or why not?
No, probably not. If something seemed serious with my skin, I’d prefer to go to a doctor instead of relying on an app. I’d trust a medical professional’s opinion over an automated one.

---

### 5. Do you already have a skincare routine? What kinds of products or methods do you use?
I don’t really have one. I just wash my face with regular soap when I shower, nothing fancy.

---

### 6. Would you feel comfortable uploading a picture of your face to an app that analyzes your skin? Why or why not?
I’d be okay with it if the app seemed legitimate and had strong privacy protection. I’d just want to be sure my data wouldn’t be shared or stored somewhere insecure.

---

### 7. What concerns might you have about privacy, data storage, or misuse of your photo?
My main concern would be data privacy. I wouldn’t want my picture used for anything else or made public without my consent. I’d want to know exactly where it’s stored and who has access.

---

### 8. How accurate would the results need to be for you to trust or act on them?
At least 95% accurate. If the accuracy was any lower, I’d treat it more like a suggestion than something to act on.

---

### 9. How would you prefer results to be displayed — for example, through a text summary, a visual skin map, or personalized recommendations?
A visual skin map would be best. It’s easier to understand when you can see what area of your skin is being analyzed instead of just reading text.

---

### 10. Have you ever used skincare products or online tools that ask for information about your skin type, allergies, or conditions? If so, how useful was that process?
No, I haven’t used anything like that before, so I don’t really have experience with it.

---

### 11. How often do you experience issues like acne, dryness, or irritation, and how do you usually address them?
Not very often. I might get mild dryness once in a while, but it’s nothing serious. I just use lotion when that happens.

---

### 12. What do you think makes a skincare app or website feel trustworthy or professional?
If it’s certified or approved by dermatologists or other medical professionals. That kind of backing would make it feel more reliable.

---

### 13. Would you be open to an app that connects you to a dermatologist or skincare expert after analyzing your image? Why or why not?
Yes, definitely. It would be useful to have an expert confirm what the app says, especially if it’s about something that could be serious.

---

### 14. If an app detected something potentially serious (like a mole that could be cancerous), how would you want that information to be delivered?
Through a private email, not a public notification. That way it’s secure and I can look at it in my own time.

---

### 15. Do you think staff members at Grinnell College would find value in this kind of skincare or skin health detection tool?
I think some would, especially those interested in skincare or health. Others might not care much, but overall it could still be helpful to have available.
