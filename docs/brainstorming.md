# Ideation -- World's Worst Idea

**Ideas:**
* Posting photos of users' skin online, or sharing these photos without their knowledge/permission
* Adding features that have nothing to do with the purpose of our app (i.e. Doordash connectivity)
* Recommending products/treatments without doing prior research into their efficacy and general reception with their respective users
* Slowness in generating results after users submit photos/information
* Doesn't give you results or personalized ones (i.e. recommending the same products over and over)
* Obscure functionality, buttons are not obvious as to how to use them/what they're for
